# Issue Regarding the Maximum Power Output of Photovoltaic Panels

## Project Description
This repository contains a series of presentations exploring various aspects related to the performance and economics of photovoltaic (PV) panels. Each presentation delves into different factors that impact the effectiveness and profitability of solar energy installations, from historical context to technical enhancements and environmental influences.

## Presentation 1: Introduction to Photovoltaic Panels
- **File**: `Presentation_1_introduction.pdf`
- **Overview**: This presentation provides foundational information about photovoltaic panels.
  - History of photovoltaic technology.
  - How PV panels work.
  - Types of panels available.
  - Pricing of panels.
  - Map of photovoltaic farms.
  - List of common issues with panels.

## Presentation 2: Costs and Profits of Photovoltaic Panels
- **File**: `Presentation_2_costs.pdf`
- **Overview**: Discusses the financial aspects of photovoltaic panel installations.
  - Costs of installing PV systems.
  - Potential savings.
  - An evolving Python application for calculating returns from PV panel installations. This application will be updated and expanded in subsequent presentations.

## Presentation 3: Impact of Cloudiness on PV Panel Returns
- **File**: `Presentation_3_cloudiness.ipynb`
- **Overview**: Enhances our application by integrating the impact of cloudiness on the returns from PV panels.
  - How cloud cover affects solar power generation and economic returns.

## Presentation 4: Environmental Influence on PV Panel Returns
- **File**: `Presentation_4_temperature.ipynb`
- **Overview**: Further refines the analysis tool by incorporating additional parameters:
  - City selection for localized analysis.
  - Installation angle of panels.
  - Panel types.
  - Temperature effects on panel efficiency and returns.

## Tools Used
- **Python Language**
  - **Libraries**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (used for data analysis and visualization in the Python applications).

All analysis and results are in Polish.
